# udacity_ml_capstone
Udacity Machine Learning - Term 2 - Capstone Project 

Initial ideas:  
- Instrument finder - Audio
  - Mobile AR app that will stream video w/ audio.
  - ML engine will filter instruments that are currently playing into separate channels.
  - Engine will determine location of instruments.
  - An option of toggling which instruments are audible
  - Super-impose regions of instruments
- Instrument finder - Instrument classification - Very challenging depending on the angle of the video
  - Determine where the different instruments are sitting.
  - Super-impose regions of instruments
- Instrument detector - What instrument did you send an image of??
  - Model would be trained on instruments
  - User sends image up to service which responds with determined instrument
- Create a symphony merging the styles of Pictures at an Exhibition (Mussorgsky) and the Pines of Rome (Respighi)
